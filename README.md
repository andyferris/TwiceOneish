# TwiceOneish

"TwiceOneish" - a play on words for "bimonoidal". The package focuses on structures
with both a direct sum and tensor product, such as that seen in a symmetric bimonoidal category.
We focus on simple Cartesian structures.

One motivation for investigating these structures is that they are a simplified
version of "group by" structures that arise in tables/dataframes. It is hoped
that understanding these will help us bring these to generalized, nested,
`Associative` containers that might represent a data table (or column, cube,
etc) in grouped form.
